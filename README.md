# RedisSessions

This is a Elixir module to keep sessions in a Redis datastore and add some useful methods.
The main purpose of this module is to generalize sessions across application server platforms.

It's also an elixir port of the node.js module [redis-sessions](https://github.com/smrchy/redis-sessions).

    ```
